### Important Note
**This EFI is Created using [OpCore-Simplify](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify)** 

**In BIOS setup you must disable the follower options:**
  - Security Boot (in this MB the Option is "Other OS")
   - CSM (The GPU VBIOS must have be supported by UEFI driver) 
		**IMPORTANT**: In case it isn't supported, you can try to update VBIOS, there are ways to update, just make a search, but do so at your own risk, I am not responsible for any damage to the GPU, this applies to any other component,
		    
### What's Working:
- Audio OnBoard
- Audio from GPU
- GPU (The CPU I use has an iGPU, but by my choice, it is disabled)
- USB
- Apple ID
- App Store
- iCloud
- USB Bluetooth (depends what device using)
- ...


### What's Not Working\Bugs:
- Sleep\Wake (Not tested properly, it seems to work, a little slow)
-  Nothing more for now, but I'll update as soon as I find it.
